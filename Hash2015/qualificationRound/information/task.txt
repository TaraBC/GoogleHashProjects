Servers in a data center are physically divided into rows. Rows can share resources such as electric
power. If such a shared resource fails, we assume that the entire row is lost and all servers in that row
become unavailable.
Servers in a data center are also logically divided into pools. Each server belongs to exactly one pool,
and provides it with some amount of computing resources, called capacity. The capacity of a pool is the
sum of the capacities of the availableservers in that pool.
To ensure reliability of a pool, it is therefore desirable to distribute its servers between different rows.
Then, when a row fails, the pool can continue to operate on the servers from the remaining rows (albeit
with a reduced capacity because of the unavailable servers). The guaranteed capacity of a pool is the
minimum capacity it will have when at most one data center row goes down.
Given a schema of a data center and a list of available servers, your goal is to assign servers to slots
within the rowsand to logical poolsso that the lowest guaranteed capacityof all pools is maximized.
