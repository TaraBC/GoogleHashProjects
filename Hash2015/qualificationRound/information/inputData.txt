The input data is provided in a plain text file containing exclusively ASCII characters with lines terminated
with a single ‘\n’ character at the end of each line (UNIX­style line endings).
The file consists of:

● one line containing the following five natural numbers separated by single spaces:
○ R(1 ≤ R ≤ 1000) denotes the number of rows in the data center,
○ S(1 ≤ S ≤ 1000) denotes the number of slots in each row of the data center,
○ U(0 ≤ U ≤ R × S) denotes the number of unavailable slots,
○ P(1 ≤ P ≤ 1000) denotes the number of pools to be created,
○ M(1 ≤ M ≤ R × S) denotes the number of servers to be allocated;

● U subsequent lines describing the unavailable slots of the data center. Each of these lines
contains two natural numbers separated by a single space: ri and si
( 0 ≤ r , ) ,
i < R 0 ≤ s
i < S
denoting the row number (ri) and the slot number within the row (si) of the particular unavailable
slot;

● M subsequent lines describing the servers to be allocated. Each of these lines contains two
natural numbers separated by a single space: zi and ci
(1 ≤ z , 000) , denoting the size i ≤ S 1 ≤ c
i ≤ 1
of the server (zi), ie. the number of slots that it occupies, and the capacity (ci) of the machine.
